# IBM_FinalProject

# This is the complete code for my final project in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate: the Applied Capstone.

## It contains the code for all steps, excluding only the Plotly Dashboard creation.

## It was an invaluable experience, this course; and I hope this will prepare me even better for a future career as a Data Scientist!
